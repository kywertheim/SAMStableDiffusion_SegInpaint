# SAMStableDiffusion_SegInpaint

Context: I completed this guided programming exercise as a part of the Udacity course titled Computer Vision and Generative AI.

The code in the Jupyter notebook uses the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to create a segmentation mask for an image. Then, it uses the Stable Diffusion model to replace the background of the masked object under the guidance of a textual prompt.
